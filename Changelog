Changelog for etymdendron

2011-08-21	v0.50
Implemented a unit testing framework for many of the functions. Abstracted the
XML access behind functions to query and set word details and such. Added more
trees to the words.xml database. Enabled edit word details functionality
within the GUI, added a right-click menu to the tree list. Can delete and
create new words from the GUI, and can delete trees (but not yet create them).
Can save out XML file after updating it. Started some automatic documentation
using Sphinx. Added a toggle-able edit mode in the GUI. Added a link to
etymonline using the right-click menu.

2011-06-19	v0.20
Basic GUI laid out. Functionality duplicates that of the command-line version:
search and display trees, get information about each entry. Word definitions
added, shown in both GUI and CLI. Only the searched-for word is emphasized
instead of the whole list of alternates.

2011-06-12	v0.10
Basic command-line functionality finished as far as searching and displaying
the XML file is finished.
