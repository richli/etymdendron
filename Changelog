Changelog for etymdendron

2011-06-19	v0.20
Basic GUI laid out. Functionality duplicates that of the command-line version:
search and display trees, get information about each entry. Word definitions
added, shown in both GUI and CLI. Only the searched-for word is emphasized
instead of the whole list of alternates.

2011-06-12	v0.10
Basic command-line functionality finished as far as searching and displaying
the XML file is finished.
