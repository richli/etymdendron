TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
* Backend
	* We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)
	* Validate the XML
	  I need some sort of schema to validate against. Choose DTD, XML Schema, or Relax NG

* Frontend
  * CLI (coming along)
	* If a word is found in more than one tree, prompt to select which tree to display
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
  * GUI (not yet started)
    * Use wxPython
