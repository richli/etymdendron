TODO for etymdendron
====================
TO WORK ON NEXT
---------------
1) Drag-and-drop elements of the tree in the tree control GUI
* Select a new word automatically upon creation
2) Create some documentation using Sphinx
  * This is started. I should format the docstrings with rST and include built documentation when I package the project with distutils.
3) Searching improvements
  * For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros; (z)un); flatten diacritics)
  * I don't have searching for PIE roots enabled yet
  * Ignore * prefix, - suffix for PIE roots

KNOWN BUGS
----------
* None that I know of :)

EVENTUALLY
----------
  * Dynamically enable save/revert buttons (disable them until changes are made to the text boxes)
  * Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
  * A taskbar icon
  http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_wxtoplevelwindow.html#wxtoplevelwindowseticons
  * GUI Layout phases:
    * Phase 1: (DONE) Just the treelist widget for now
    * Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
    * Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
