TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
* Frontend
  * GUI (started, using wxPython)
    * Finish functionality to duplicate the CLI version
		* Implement search using selected word
		* Implement choosing a word that's in multiple trees
	* Implement edit mode toggle
	* Phase 1: Just the treelist widget for now
	* Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
	* Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
	* Maybe create a link to the entry on etymonline?
	* A taskbar icon
  * CLI (coming along)
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
	* Add some unit testing so the changes I make to the code don't break things
	* Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
	* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros)

* Backend
  * We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)

To work on after I get the GUI caught up:
* Automated testing
* Add options to edit the tree within the program (CLI and GUI)
* Export the modified XML file (this should be really easy)
