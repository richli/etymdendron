TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
TO WORK ON NEXT:
* Automated testing
  http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/1.0.0/
  http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html
  http://diveintopython.org/unit_testing/index.html
* Add options to edit the tree within the program (CLI and GUI)
* Export the modified XML file (this should be really easy)

* Frontend
  * GUI
	* Implement edit mode toggle
	  * Edit entries of the tree
	  * Drag-and-drop elements of the tree
	  * Create new entries in the tree
	* Maybe create a link to the entry on etymonline?
	* A taskbar icon
	* GUI Layout phases:
  	  * Phase 1: (DONE) Just the treelist widget for now
  	  * Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
  	  * Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
  * CLI
	* Add some unit testing so the changes I make to the code don't break things
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
	* Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
	* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros)

* Backend
  * We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)
