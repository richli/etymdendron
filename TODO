TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
TO WORK ON NEXT:
* Add options to edit the tree within the program (both CLI and GUI)
  * Start with editing the details of an existing element
  * Then add an element, specify the parents/children of the element
  * Then remove an element (children become its siblings)
  * Moving an element is then a combo of adding and removing, but mind the children
  * The above is working within a tree, I then need to create a new tree
* Export the modified XML file (this should be really easy since I'm using ElementTree)

* Frontend
  * GUI
	* Implement edit mode toggle
	  * Edit entries of the tree
	  * Create new entries in the tree
	  * Remove entries from the tree
	  * Drag-and-drop elements of the tree
	* Maybe create a link to the entry on etymonline?
	* A taskbar icon
	* GUI Layout phases:
  	  * Phase 1: (DONE) Just the treelist widget for now
		* Phase 1 improvement: put search bar at the top?
  	  * Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
  	  * Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
  * CLI
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
	  * Edit entries of the tree
	  * Create new entries in the tree
	  * Remove entries from the tree
	* Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
	* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros)

* Backend
  * We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)

* Create some documentation using Sphinx?
