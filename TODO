TODO for etymdendron
====================
TO WORK ON NEXT
---------------
* Backend functions to edit the tree
  * Implement editWordParent(), deleteWord(), createWord()
  * Add functions to:
    * Move a word (it's then a combo of adding and removing, but mind the children)
  * The above is working within a tree, I then need to create a new tree
* I don't have searching for PIE roots enabled yet
* Ignore * prefix, - suffix for PIE roots
* GUI
  * Implement more editing
    * Create new entries in the tree
    * Remove entries from the tree
    * Drag-and-drop elements of the tree
    * Create a new tree
  * Maybe create a link to the entry on etymonline
  * A taskbar icon
* Create some documentation using Sphinx
* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros)

EVENTUALLY
----------
  * Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
  * GUI Layout phases:
    * Phase 1: (DONE) Just the treelist widget for now
    * Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
    * Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
