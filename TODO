TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
* Backend
	* We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)
	* Validate the XML
	  I need some sort of schema to validate against. Choose DTD, XML Schema, or Relax NG

* Frontend
  * CLI (coming along)
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
	* Add some unit testing so the changes I make to the code don't break things
	* Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
	* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros)
  * GUI (not yet started)
    * Use wxPython

To work on next:
2) Re-write code to use XPath to find desired nodes
3) XML schema creation (Use DTD)
4) XML validation
5) Automated testing
6) Start on GUI
7) Add options to edit the tree within the program
