TODO for etymdendron
--------------------
* Backend
	* We're using libxml (using lxml) for now, maybe make it a db sometime? (looking into SQLAlchemy)
	* Validate the XML
	  I need some sort of schema to validate against. Choose DTD, XML Schema, or Relax NG

* Frontend
  * CLI (coming along)
    * Make options to edit the tree and save out the XML
	* Add some unit testing so the changes I make to the code don't break things
	* Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
  * GUI (not yet started)
    * Use wxPython

To work on next:
1) XML schema creation
2) XML validation
3) Automated testing
4) Add options to edit the tree within the program
5) Start on GUI
