TODO for etymdendron
====================
TO WORK ON NEXT
---------------
* Backend functions to edit the tree
  * Add functions to:
    * Move a word (it's then a combo of adding and removing, but mind the children)
  * Create/delete new trees
* GUI
  * Implement more editing
    * Drag-and-drop elements of the tree
    * Create a new tree (added a menu item)
  * Create a link to the entry on etymonline
  * A taskbar icon
  http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_wxtoplevelwindow.html#wxtoplevelwindowseticons
* I don't have searching for PIE roots enabled yet
* Ignore * prefix, - suffix for PIE roots
* For searching, add options to do non-exact matches (partial words; account for variant spellings in the XML (such as ros,hros; (z)un); flatten diacritics)
* Create some documentation using Sphinx
  * This is started. I should format the docstrings with rST and include built documentation when I package the project with distutils.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
* Cannot delete the tree root (raises an exception)

EVENTUALLY
----------
  * Add more words to words.xml, add more tests
  * GUI Layout phases:
    * Phase 1: (DONE) Just the treelist widget for now
    * Phase 2: Use Graphviz to plot the trees? (pydot, pygraphviz, networkx, python-graph?)
    * Phase 3: Use floatcanvas to have interactive trees?
